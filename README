There was a link to Jikky's R file in there somewhere too which I can't now
find. But I have included the file.

These are the results:

131 / 22393 in vax arm went from NEG to POS
353 / 22333 in placebo arm went from NEG to POS
(131 / 22393) / (353 / 22333)
[69.68763000581791, 62.98895256244712, 54.809946147803636]

And this if we only consider rows before 2020-11-15:

Vax arm: 131 went NEG->POS. 20863 stayed NEG.
Placebo arm: 353 went NEG->POS. 20381 stayed NEG.
(131 / 20994) / (353 / 20734)
[69.98074750262458, 63.349112831644064, 55.25246571862502]

Considering only rows before 2020-11-15
Vax arm: 75 went NEG->POS. 15919 stayed NEG.
Placebo arm: 160 went NEG->POS. 15708 stayed NEG.
(75 / 15994) / (160 / 15868)
[64.61908262859943, 53.494279104664244, 38.87150937066692]
